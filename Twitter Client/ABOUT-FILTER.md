# Why are my tweets not being displayed??

This document describes the filters and limits that govern which messages will be displayed. If you are tweeting [@PixelPromenade](https://twitter.com/pixelpromenade) and your messages are not appearing, please read carefully.

### Your tweet contains unacceptable language
Though we rather dislike limiting speech, PixelPromenade is a family friendly public display and as such we have taken reason

### Your Tweet contains emoji or other unsupported characters
PixelPromenade can only display characters from Latin alphabets (specifically  [CP-1252 encoding](http://www.cp1252.com/)). Messages with emoji or unicode characters outside of this set will not be displayed.

### Your tweet contains photo, video, or ticker symbols
PixelPromenade only displays text and will throw away any tweet with visual media attached. Additionally, messages containing financial symbols (a dollar sign followed by a stock designation, e.g. "[$BGE](#)" ) will not be shown.

### You ask too frequently, or are trying to bypass the language filter
In the interest of fairness, any one user can only post a few tweets each day. Employing tricks to bypass the unacceptable language filter will get you blocked, though we applaud your creativity.

### We're not checking Twitter constantly
The robot running the bridge checks for new tweets every few minutes. You may simply need to wait for the next poll interval.

### Screen time prioritizes the interactive patterns
If you meet all the conditions above and still don't see your message, it may be because we limit how much time the bridge spends displaying tweets. It's really awesome that so many people want to tweet at us, but we don't want the display to be a constant stream of text - the patterns are too pretty!

### Tweeting may be disabled
If this feature is abused, it will simply be removed. If this happens, we will post a message at the top of this document. Please don't ruin it for everyone.
