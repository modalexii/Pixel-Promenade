# Pixel-Promenade
An interactive LED light canopy comprised of a matrix of over 10,000 LEDs on display at Light City Baltimore 2015. The canopy acts as a screen, displaying patterns and colors that shift based on information received by a network of proximity sensors relaying the amount and position of pedestrian traffic below. It also displays messages submitted via its Twitter feed.

## Repo Contents
* Configuration files for MADRIX, the lighting control software
* MADRIX scripts that govern the interactive and noninteravtive functions
* Arduino sketches running the Art-Net endpoints that drive the canopy LEDs
* The Twitter application that pulls user-submitted text and feeds it to MADRIX
* The performance monitoring script that runs on the lighting control system
